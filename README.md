# Image_Captioning_Project
This project demonstrates the use of the `blip-image-captioning-base` model, a powerful tool for generating descriptive text captions from images. Built upon the innovative BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) architecture, this model excels at understanding and describing visual content.
